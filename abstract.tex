Due to the complexity of financial market and the interconnectedness and interdependencies of industry sectors in the economy, the price returns of each coupling stocks might have certain underlying economic link. Such behaviours can hardly be explained by traditional financial models and theories. This project combines machine learning techniques, individual stock features, and empirical data of Industry Economic Accounts (IEAs) from Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the US to predict Granger causality of coupling US stocks. Limited Granger causalities are calculated as a small sample set compared to the target date set. A directed weighted complex network (DWCN) is constructed by considering companies as nodes, correlations of abnormal stock returns (alpha) as weights of links, and predicted Granger causalities indicate directions of links. The generated DWCN is visualised and its topological properties, stability, and effects on individual stocks and industries are researched in this paper. Suggestions towards financial market investment are provided based on the results of this research.
