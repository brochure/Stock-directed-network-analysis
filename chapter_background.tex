\section{Introduction}
This chapter will introduce the development of quantitative finance, stock market insights, and complex networks theory.

\section{Background}
\subsection{Historical review of quantitative finance and stock market investment}
The theoretical foundations of quantitative finance including efficient market theory, behavioural finance, asset allocation theory and chaos theory.

The revolutionary who pioneered the theory of asset allocation, Markowitz (1952) proposed the idea of efficient frontier and the mean-variance model, which established a clear mathematical definition of the two previously vague concepts of risk and return~\cite{portfolio}. Markowitz (1956, 1959) then presents the properties and formulas for efficient frontier~\cite{markowitz1956optimization} and generalised it by allowing an arbitrary, possibly singular, covariance matrix~\cite{markowitz1959portfolio}. Tobin (1958) developed Markowitz's theory and added the concept of risk free assets~\cite{tobin1958liquidity}. Sharp (1964) and Linter (1965) added two key assumptions based on the mean-variance model to enable the portfolio mean-variance valid, forming a capital asset pricing model (CAPM) with the support of economic theories~\cite{equilibrium, diversification}. The CAPM believes that only non-dispersible systemic risks can be compensated off, while non-systematic risks can be eliminated by effectively decentralised investments. Investors could only assume systemic risks through decentralised investment. The systematic risk of a single security or portfolio can be characterised by beta, which represents the extent to which a single security or portfolio is affected by the overall market volatility. And later, Richard Michaud and Robert Michaud (1998) addressed the information uncertainty in risk-return estimates by the invention of the Re-sampled Efficient portfolio~\cite{michaud1998asset}.

Since the invention of the CAPM, worldwide scholars had been actively conducting empirical tests towards the practicality of the CAPM, while early results show that \textit{beta} is able to explain the return movements of stock prices. However, in the late 1970s, some empirical studies on the CAPM began to show that a large part of the changes in the stock returns cannot be explained by \textit{beta}, as anomalies about market return were increasingly found.

Researchers had proposed models and theories considering the individual stock features to explain such anomalies. For instance, Fama and French (1993, 1996) proposed a three-factor model based on the inter-temporal capital asset model (ICAPM) \cite{intertemporal} proposed by Merton (1973) and the arbitrage pricing theory (APT)~\cite{options} proposed by Cox et al.(1976), which reveals a large part of the cross-section of the stocks’ average return that cannot be explained by CAPM, can be explained using firm size, book-to-market equity ratio, and overall market return~\cite{riskfactors, anomalies}.

Quantitative finance combines mathematics, statistics, econometrics, machine learning and empirical finance to provide a solid analytical foundation for the analysis of financial issues, especially for the investments in financial markets such as stock, future, option and forex.

\subsection{Theory of complex networks}
Complex networks are the networks that have some or all of the properties from self-organisation, self-similarity, attractors, small-world and scale-free. A large number of complex systems that exist in nature or society can be described by a variety of networks. A typical network consists of a number of nodes and edges which connect these nodes, where nodes are used to represent different individuals in the real system and edges are used to represent the relationships between individuals. In certain cases, a particular relationship is described as an edge between two nodes, otherwise, it is not connected. Two nodes with edge are considered as adjacent among the network.

For instance, the nervous system can be regarded as a network formed by a large number of nerve cells interconnected by nerve fibres~\cite{watts1998collective}. The computer networks can be regarded as a network in which autonomously working computers are connected to each other through communication media such as optical cables, twisted pairs, coaxial cables, etc~\cite{watts1998collective}. In addition, there are more complex networks like electric power networks~\cite{faloutsos1999power}, social networks~\cite{watts1998collective, hofman2017prediction, ebel2002scale}, etc.

\subsection{Complex networks theory applied in Finance}
While traditional stock pricing models still capture limited forms of financial behaviour, according to Johnson et al. (2003), the premises of standard financial theory contradict the modern notion of financial markets are complex systems~\cite{financialcomplex}, by which many statistical niceties such as stationarity no longer can be taken for granted. Recent researches have implemented the network theory to reveal the underlying factors of price movements. Huang et al. (2009) implemented the threshold method to construct correlation network in China's A-Share stock market and studied the topological properties and topological stability of the network~\cite{chinesenetwork}. Namaki et al. (2011) utilised Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to specify the biggest eigenvector in the complex network of price correlations~\cite{genuine}. Yu (2013) studied the evolution of gold price from a network perspective using the visibility network approach~\cite{visibility}. Chopra and Khanna (2015) developed a framework which associates the economic input–output (EIO) model with techniques for understanding interdependencies and interconnectedness in the economy of US, based on complex networks theory~\cite{intercd}. Boginski et al. (2005) identified cliques and independent groups among stock networks~\cite{statisticalanalysis}.  Chen et al. (2015) studied the inter-stock and inter-industry effects towards stock returns based on the topological properties of a complex network of correlations~\cite{CHEN2015224}.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter the development of analytical finance, stock market insights, and complex networks theory have been introduced.
In a nutshell, prevailing complex network approaches to analyse stock markets are almost all about investigating weighted or unweight but undirected networks. To the best knowledge of mine, no previous work has attempted to construct a directed network so far.
