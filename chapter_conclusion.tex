\section{Summary of results}
This thesis studied the directed complex networks of US stock market in 2016. The directions and weights of edges are determined by the economical transaction relations and stock price correlation coefficients respectively. Overall, the characteristics of topology properties have not changed significantly from undirected weighted stock networks from other literatures which used correlation coefficients of stock prices as the weights of edges. However, from the new horizon, this paper is able to analyse on a higher dimensionality -- topological property research and community detection with methods for directed networks which utilised the feature of edge directions. The resulting features of power-law and small-world for directed stock complex networks show continuity with the results in undirected stock complex networks researches. The study on community detection suggests "livelihood" and "production" are the most dominant and influential sectors in the stock market and the "finance" sector has extremely strong internal connections. The partitioned communities are highly related with the economical activities among industries and indicate the potential cascading impact from a collapse of a specific firm or sector. The theoretical and practical contributions of aforementioned findings have been discussed.

% This thesis has found the directed stock network is consistent with the undirected-weighted networks about some important topological properties in previous studies, i.e, they are both small-world and scale-free. The study on community detection suggests "livelihood" and "production" are the most dominant and influential sectors in the stock market and the "finance" sector has extremely strong internal connections. This thesis also has found that there is significant negative relationship between standard deviation of stock price return and its corresponding betweenness centrality.

\section{Future work}
In terms of future work, stock complex networks during a longer range of years can be generated and compared in together, the periods correspond to bull, bear, and stable market can be recognised and analysed separately and accordingly. New methods for determining the directions of edges to generate directed complex networks are expected to be proposed.
