\chapter[Conclusions]{Conclusions and future watch}
This paper studied the directed complex networks of US stock market of 2016. The directions and weights of edges are determined by the economical transaction relations and stock price correlation coefficients respectively. Overall, the characteristics of topology properties have not changed significantly from undirected weighted stock networks from other literatures which used correlation coefficients of stock prices as the weights of edges. However, from the new horizon, this paper is able to analyse on a higher dimensionality -- topological property research and community detection with methods for directed networks which utilised the feature of edge directions. The resulting features of power-law and small-world for directed stock complex networks show continuity with the results in undirected stock complex networks researches. The partitioned communities are highly related with the economical activities among industries and indicate the potential cascading impact from a collapse of a specific firm or sector.

In terms of future work, stock complex networks in more years can be generated and compared in together, the periods correspond to bull, bear and stable market can be recognised and analysed separately and accordingly. New methods for determining the directions of edges to generate directed complex networks are expected to be proposed.
