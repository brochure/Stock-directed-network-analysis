It is not hard to see the composition of stock market are mainly dominated by the finance-related industry ("Banks, credit intermediation, and related activities", "Funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles", "Insurance carriers and related activities", "Securities, commodity contracts, and investments", etc.) and computer-related industry ("Computer and electronic products", "Computer systems design and related services", "Data processing, internet publishing, and other information services", "Electrical equipment, appliances, and components", etc.). The total numbers of finance-related industry and computer-related industry are over 473 and 220 respectively, which jointly take almost half of the number of total stocks. Therefore, it is necessary to use the formalised formula~ which divides the value by the number of stocks in its belonging industrial sector, punishing the connection from or to a node by the industry size, i.e., if a stock is in a large industry, it will need higher transaction flows to connect to other nodes in the network.

\section{Networks construction}
This thesis first generated matrices of normalised direct demand \textbf{A}, normalised direct requirement \textbf{B}, correlation coefficient \textbf{C} using formula~\ref{equ:eio_i}, \ref{equ:eio_o}, and \ref{equ:corr}.

Figure~\ref{fig:eio_transaction_density} from normalised direct demand \textbf{A} and normalised direct requirement \textbf{B} illustrates that the transaction densities decrease as threshold of normalised direct requirement and normalised direct demand increase, and their patterns are very similar with the same inflection point at around $threshold=0.136$ where the densities begin to decline. Therefore, the values of thresholds for normalised direct requirement and normalised direct demand are set to be equal, i.e., $\theta_{EIO}=\theta_{DD}=\theta_{DR}$, to filter the directed edges among the stock network.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{eio_transaction_density}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Transaction densities in EIO. The density of transactions drops vertically at the threshold of 0, which means nearly a quarter of values in the normalised direct demand matrix \textbf{A} and normalised direct requirement \textbf{B} are $0$. Then the two densities both decrease from the point around 0.136, and overall they follow a same pattern.}
	\label{fig:eio_transaction_density}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:correlation_distribution} shows the distribution of stock price correlation coefficients has a shape complies to the normal distribution. Most correlation coefficients are vary from $-0.2$ to $0.85$ with the mean of $0.265$. Figure~\ref{fig:correlation_edge_density} also shows that the edge density drops dramatically as the correlation coefficient increases from $0$ to $0.50$. It implies that the prices of most stocks traded in NYSE and NASDAQ often fluctuate to the same direction, but the patterns are less similar to each other.

	\caption{Numbers of directed edges per EIO-threshold and correlation-coefficient-threshold}
	\label{fig:amounts_of_edges_threshold}  
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:amounts_of_edges_threshold} shows the number of directed edges remain at the conditions of different value combinations of $\{\theta_{EIO}$, $\theta_{corr}\}$. When both of the thresholds set to be minimal at their own value range, i.e., $\theta_{EIO}=0$ and $\theta_{corr}=-1$, the number of directed edges is $N\times(N-1)=2,009,306$, while $N$ indicates the total number of nodes, which is $1418$. According to the figure~\ref{fig:amounts_of_edges_threshold}, the number of edges will be less than $100,000$, in which case the network has a density of lower than $5\%$, if $\theta_{EIO}\geq0.3545$ or $\theta_{corr}\geq0.5020$.

		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Graph_01}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Transaction densities}
	\label{fig:Graph_01}
\end{figure}


It is obvious that the larger values assigned to $\theta_{EIO}$ and $\theta_{corr}$, the more significant will be for the weights and directions of the remaining edges. But if the network becomes too sparse, it can not be strongly or even weakly connected and there would be many independent cliques, hence the network becomes too inefficient to be a senseful network. As a result, this paper selects the threshold-value-pair $\{\theta_{EIO}=0.292, \theta_{corr}=0.379\}$ to construct a directed unweighted network and a directed weighted network for the 2016 US stock market.

\section{Analysis of the directed unweighted network}
% 对幂指数分布的统计检验
A directed Watts Strogatz small-world (WS) network and a random network with the same number of nodes and similar number of edges with the stock directed unweighted network are generated. Table~\ref{tab:three} compares the main topologies of the three networks.

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|}\hline\hline
			Directed networks&Stock network&Small-world network&Random network\\\hline
			Number of nodes&1418&1418&1418\\

			Local efficiency&0.6276&0.5027&0.4456\\
			Assortativity&0.02004&-0.002180&0.001452\\
			\hline\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Main properties of stock network, small-world network, and random network}\label{tab:three}
\end{table}

\subsection{Power-law distribution}

According to the table~\ref{tab:three}, the values of average out-degrees of stock network, small-world network and random network are almost the same due to the identical numbers of nodes and edges, but in terms of the distributions of out-degrees, stock network is totally different from the others. 

Figure~\ref{fig:distributionsm} and \ref{fig:distributionrd} show clearly that the out-degree distributions of small-world network and random network follow the normal distribution, i.e, most degree numbers of nodes fall in the middle range, while figure~\ref{fig:G_out_degree_distribution_square} illustrates that for the stock network, only a few number of nodes show higher out-degree, while most nodes are in the positions of low out-degree level. The distribution of the directed stock price return networks follows power-law distribution with the exponent of 4.057.

%Power-law distribution reveals that most of the nodes have a small degree while a few modes have a higher degree.
\subsection{Small-world property}
The average path length of small-world network and random network are both close to 2, indicates that taking any node in the network, it can expect to reach any other nodes just through one node as medium. For stock network, the expectation number of medium nodes is 1.775, which is also a small number for connection, so like small-world and random networks, stock network also has the small-world property.

% Efficiency.

Although the assortativity values for the three networks are all non-significant, 

\subsection{Community structure of the directed unweighted stock network}
The larger value of clustering coefficient for stock network than the other two networks indicating that the nodes in stock network tend to cluster together. Therefore, communities of stock network will be identified implementing the \textit{algorithm~\ref{alg:communitydetection}} for directed networks in this section. According to the composition of industrial sectors of each community, as figure~\ref{fig:community_sector_stacked} shows, the following five communities are identified: (1) Production (2) Finance (3) Livelihood (4) Insurance and chemical products (5) Utilities and financial vehicles.

The communities of production (purple) and livelihood (blue) are sparsely distributed while there are some large-sized nodes acting as hubs of the overall network. The hubs not only connect to the nodes of same communities, but also the externals. These two communities are partially intertwined due to the high relevancy of production industry and livelihood industry. 

Unlike the above two communities, it can be seen from figure~\ref{fig:community_graph} that the community of finance (green) is decentralised, i.e., there is no obvious hubs and the degrees of each node distribute evenly. It also has a very dense structure, connected closely inside and completely exclusive from other nodes or communities. This means the co-movements among financial stocks are incredibly strong and economically they rely tightly to each other.

The other two communities are more interesting because of their peculiar structural features. Every industrial sectors of individual stocks in community are identified to investigate the properties of the community of insurance and chemical products (yellow). As figure~\ref{fig:community_4} illustrates and through the investigation, almost all firms in the upper and lower clusters are in the sectors of "chemical products" and "insurance carriers and related activities" respectively, while firms between the two big clusters, like "MCK" (McKesson) and "CAH" (Cardinal Health), are large medical supplier, pharmaceutical and heathcare service companies with high out-degrees to both of the two clusters. Apart from that, there are also a considerable number of links from the nodes in upper cluster to the hubs of chemical companies. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the prices of medicines have significant influence to medical insurance industry, additionally the purchases of chemical products of pharmaceutical firms and the sales of chemical products have made pharmaceutical and chemical companies influence to each other.

Another investigation towards the community of utilities and financial vehicles (orange) is conducted by the same measure. As figure~\ref{fig:community_5} illustrates, there is only one huge hub (PDM) which is the company "Piedmont Office Realty Trust" among the whole community while all the others are one-degree nodes located remotely. There are more links from the hub to the rest than the opposite direction, and also the weights of the former links are generally higher. The hub, "Piedmont Office Realty Trust", is a real estate investment trust company, and the rest in the community contains 59 "funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles" firms and 44 "utilities" firms. For a big realty trust enterprise, demand for financial trust business is extremely high, and its successes of investments upon real estates will promote the development of utilities companies. It depicts that the major realty trust enterprise alone has significant influence to all of these financial trust and utilities companies.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis on the relationship between price return and betweenness centrality}
Figures~\ref{fig:bivariate} reveal the relationships between betweenness centralities and price returns of stocks. First, in figure~\ref{subfig:sum_return_weighted_centrality} as much more nodes have low betweenness centrality values (lower than $0.001$), and the cumulative sum of returns fall intensively in the range of $(-0.1, 0.6)$, while that of the nodes with high betweenness centrality values (higher than $0.001$) also fall evenly in the same range Therefore, there is no significant difference between the expected return for stocks with different betweenness centrality values.

Second, according to the figure~\ref{subfig:std_return_weighted_centrality}, in spite of several outliers, as the betweenness centrality of nodes becomes higher, there will be a higher possibility of nodes tend to have low standard deviation of stock daily return. This indicates the hubs in the network have considerably stable return during the specified researched year among the whole stock market. The average standard deviation for all values of betweenness centrality remain similar because of the more frequent occurrences of outliers with higher betweenness centralities from the figure.

As a result, although choosing stocks with high centralities possibly will not bring a higher expected return for a portfolio, they have the functionality of decreasing the overall risks and generating more stable returns, which is also a vital feature for stock investment.
